      <description>Background I like the idea of short posts focussing on one function because there are so many great functions out there. I had been thinking about doing a function a week for a while. A post a week is way too ambitious but a month sounds better than most other time periods so I am sticking with it.
 Uncount A function that I think is really under appreciated is uncount.</description>
