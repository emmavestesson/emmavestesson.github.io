      <description>Gender pay gap hackathon (part 2) This is part 2 of my blog about the gender pay gap hack that I went to. You can read part 1 here.
 Reflections It has taken me a long time to write the second part of my experience of the hackathon. I think this is partly because I was unsure how/whether to show the dashboard. This was my first attempt at a shiny dashboard and I did not focus on picking the best metrics for the graphs so I don’t feel like I am showing anything useful and I don’t like the thought of sharing graphs that I am not sure are displaying the data in an appropriate way.</description>
