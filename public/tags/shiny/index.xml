      <description>Background Back in March I wrote a blog post about my favourite board game Settlers of Catan. The code generates a random catan board but there is no interactivity for when you want to create a different random board. You can read it in its entirety here and somewhere in that post I promised to actually create an app so you can create your own board. I tried when I wrote the original blog post but I struggled with Shiny.</description>

      <description>Gender pay gap hackathon (part 2) This is part 2 of my blog about the gender pay gap hack that I went to. You can read part 1 here.
 Reflections It has taken me a long time to write the second part of my experience of the hackathon. I think this is partly because I was unsure how/whether to show the dashboard. This was my first attempt at a shiny dashboard and I did not focus on picking the best metrics for the graphs so I don’t feel like I am showing anything useful and I don’t like the thought of sharing graphs that I am not sure are displaying the data in an appropriate way.</description>

      <description>Inspiration I was having lunch with some colleagues the other day when they told me about a restaurant spreadsheet that they used to use to randomly pick a place to get lunch from. I of course felt the need to see if I could create something similar in R.
I had also seen a really cool blog post using the osmdata package to look at the number of pubs close to metro stations in Paris.</description>
