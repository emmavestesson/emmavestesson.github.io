      <description>Gender pay gap hackathon (part 2) This is part 2 of my blog about the gender pay gap hack that I went to. You can read part 1 here.
 Reflections It has taken me a long time to write the second part of my experience of the hackathon. I think this is partly because I was unsure how/whether to show the dashboard. This was my first attempt at a shiny dashboard and I did not focus on picking the best metrics for the graphs so I don’t feel like I am showing anything useful and I don’t like the thought of sharing graphs that I am not sure are displaying the data in an appropriate way.</description>

      <description>Gender pay gap hackathon Last weekend I went to my first hackathon. It was organised by the AI club for gender minorities, codebar and ellpha. We used data on the gender pay gap available here. I had a great time so I wanted to share my experience. This is the first part of my first hackathon.
 The deep dive team There were different tables with different themes and I picked deep dive.</description>

      <description>Inspiration I was having lunch with some colleagues the other day when they told me about a restaurant spreadsheet that they used to use to randomly pick a place to get lunch from. I of course felt the need to see if I could create something similar in R.
I had also seen a really cool blog post using the osmdata package to look at the number of pubs close to metro stations in Paris.</description>

      <description>Getting the data A couple of months ago I discovered a package developed by Public Health England that makes it easier to extract the data behind their fingertips website (https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/). I wanted to try it and as I like maps I decided to download some data at CCG level and make an interactive choropleth map using the leaflet package. I use select_indicators to browse the indicators and pick one at random that seems to have CCG level data.</description>
