      <description>Settlers of catan In our living room there is an old chest hiding some real treasures. Every now and again we will get Settlers of Satan out. I never grow tired of playing it as the board changes every time. The game has 19 hexagon shaped tiles that are placed at random. Eighteen tiles are linked to different resources -wheat, rock, wood, sheep and clay- and the 19th is the desert where the much feared robber lives.</description>
