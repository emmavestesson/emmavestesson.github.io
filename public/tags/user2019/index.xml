      <description>It is Friday evening and my train from Toulouse is delayed [update: train ended up being 2h30 min late, please take this into account when judging this post on its length and coherence.]. My bag is heavy from all the stickers I have aquired and it is too hot for me to stroll around Toulouse. What better than to write up my thoughts on useR!2019?
Overall impression I have had such a good time and I am leaving full of inspiration to try new packages and ways of working.</description>
