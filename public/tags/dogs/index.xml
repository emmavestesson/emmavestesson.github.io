      <description>Who is the bestest dog? After calling my parents’ dog the bestest dog of all I wanted to find out who the internet thought was the bestest dog. “We rate dogs” on twitter was the obvious choice as the almighty judge of all dogs.
I started by pulling all tweets by @rate_dogs using the twitteR and ROAuth packages. I decide to not include retweets or replies as I only cared about the official opinion of @rate_dogs.</description>
