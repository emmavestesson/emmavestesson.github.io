      <description>Background I’ve started a PhD! This has given me yet another reason to up my markdown game and this week I submitted my first abstract written in Rmarkdown. I’m planning on spending my PhD wasting way to much time obessing about my workflow. So why not get started? A few things worked well and some aspects still need some work.
