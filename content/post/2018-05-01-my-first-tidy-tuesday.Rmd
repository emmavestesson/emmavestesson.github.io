# Tidy Tuesday

I have seen some cool graphs on twitter created for [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md). I wanted to join in on the fun so I downloaded the data from week 3. The data are from [our world in data](https://ourworldindata.org/what-does-the-world-die-from) and I downloaded the data file from [github](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data).

```{r}
mortality <- readxl::read_excel(here::here("global_mortality.xlsx"))
glimpse(mortality)
```



The variable names had some special characters so I started by doing some name tidying. 
```{r}
names(mortality)<- mortality %>% 
  names() %>% 
  to_snake_case() %>% 
  str_remove(pattern="\\(%\\)") %>% 
  str_replace_all(pattern="-", "_") %>% 
  str_replace_all(pattern="/", "_")  %>% 
  str_replace_all(pattern="\\(", "_") %>% 
  str_remove(pattern="\\)") 

```


Next it was time to reshape the data.
```{r, interval = 0.05}
world <- mortality %>% 
  filter(country=="World") %>% 
  select(-country_code) %>% 
  gather(key=disease, value ="percent", -(country:year))

```
There is a lot of data so I decided to plot a time series for the five diseases that killed the most people in 2016.
```{r}
top5_world <- world %>% 
  filter(year==2016) %>% 
  arrange(desc(percent)) %>% 
  top_n(5) 

```


I have been trying to get a different project to work in `tweenr` for a while so I thought that this was a good time to try my luck on a different data set. This data set is very similar to the gapminder data that is used in a `tweenr` tutorial so I relied heavily on that [code](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/05/tweenr.html). 

```{r}
mortality_edit <- world %>% 
  filter(disease %in% top5_world$disease) %>% 
  select(-country) %>% 
  rename(x=year,y=percent,time=year) %>%
  mutate(ease="linear") 

mortality_tween <- tween_elements(mortality_edit, time="time", group="disease", ease="ease", nframes=150) %>% 
  mutate(year = round(time), disease = .group) %>%
  left_join(world, by=c("disease","year")) %>% 
  mutate(disease=Hmisc::capitalize(str_replace(disease, pattern="_", " ")))

```


It worked! Now I just need to apply my new skills to my old project. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p2 <- ggplot(mortality_tween,
             aes(x=year, y=percent, group=disease, frame = .frame, cumulative = TRUE)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=disease), size=1) + theme_minimal() + ggtitle("Top 5 causes of death in the world") +
  xlab("Year") + scale_colour_discrete(name  ="Disease")

gganimate(p2, title_frame = FALSE,interval = 0.05, filename ="world_mortality_2016.gif")
```
