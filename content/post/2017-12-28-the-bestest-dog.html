<h2>Who is the bestest dog?</h2>
<p>After calling my parents’ dog the bestest dog of all I wanted to find out who the internet thought was the bestest dog. “We rate dogs” on twitter was the obvious choice as the almighty judge of all dogs.</p>
<p>I started by pulling all tweets by <span class="citation">@rate_dogs</span></p>
<pre class="r"><code>rate_dogs_list &lt;- userTimeline(&quot;dog_rates&quot;,n=500,includeRts = FALSE, excludeReplies=TRUE)

rate_dogs_df &lt;- twListToDF(rate_dogs_list)</code></pre>
<p>I decide to not include retweets or replies as I only cared about the official opinion of <span class="citation">@rate_dogs</span></p>
<p>Once I had the raw data I needed to extract the scores. I did this using a regular expression that looked for a number followed by “/10”. For some reason I don’t understand the variable I created was added to the data set as a matrix so I had to add a step to make it a vector.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rate_dogs_scored &lt;- rate_dogs_df %&gt;% 
  mutate(score=str_match(text,pattern=&quot;[0-9]+/10&quot;)) 

rate_dogs_scored$score &lt;- as.vector(rate_dogs_scored$score)
 
ggplot(rate_dogs_scored, aes(x=score,y=favoriteCount)) + geom_point() +
  theme_bw() + ggtitle(&quot;Distribution of scores&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Favourites&quot;)</code></pre>
