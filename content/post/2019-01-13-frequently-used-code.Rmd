## Motivation

There are some things that I always forget how to do in R. I have decided to add some of those code snippets to this blog so I that I can look them up when I need them.

### Droping variables using a vector of names

I often have a pre-specified vector of variables names that I use frequently and sometimes I want to drop those variables. The trick is to use `one_of` around the vector with variable names. The other day I spent 10 minutes trying things like `any_of` but it should be `one_of`. Now I will never forget (or if I forget then I can read my own blog)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
vars_to_drop <- c('Wind', 'Temp')
airquality <- airquality %>% 
  select(-one_of(vars_to_drop))

```
